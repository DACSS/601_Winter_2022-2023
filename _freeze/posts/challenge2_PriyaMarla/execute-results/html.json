There are about 2930 rows and 3 columns where each row represents the total number of employees in each state and county. There a total of 53 states and 1709 counties. The maximum number of employee count recorded is 8207 and minimum count is 1. The average of total_employees in the entire dataset is 87.17816.\n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`.

Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\nData Analysis has been performed on the column state. Here each row represents a state and there are 53 unique states in the data set. State \"TX\" has recorded highest number of employees i.e 19839 and least is \"AP\" with 1 employee. Even though \"TX\" recorded highest employee count, the minimum number of employee in one of the counties is 1 and highest is 4235 making the average as 89.76. Highest average of employees are recorded in state \"DE\" and least in \"AP\". The minimum employees in most of the states in a particular county is 1 which is way less than state mean. \n",
