We started by looking at all of the data as in challenge 1 and learn that the dataset is a record of employee counts who work in the railroad industry grouped by counties and their corresponding states, an interesting observation was that the `state` variable has 53 unique entries which means that the term is used loosely here and it also includes overseas employees. \n\nAfter that we used grouped summary statistics to look at the states with the highest and lowest employee counts along with the mean/median employee counts. We observed that some states have a high dispersion of employee count values across counties. This could be a useful metric to determine which counties are understaffed compared to what they need. `Texas` and `Virginia` jumped out to me during the analysis because the mean employee count was low and the standard deviation was very high. This could imply disproportionate allocation of resources, which seems true in the case of `Texas` but further analysis showed that `Virginia` uses a catchall term called `Independent City` to count employees that don't necessarily belong to a county. This accounts for most of the spread.\n",
