- was interested in cognitive neuroscience, including topics such as memory, decision-making, and consciousness
- currently work at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center as a Data Coordinator
- use Matlab to process non-invasive brain stimulation neural data (TMS-EEG) to identify electrophysiological markers of neurodegenerative disorders

## R experience
- took an introductory statistics course that used R during college, but definitely want to dive deeper with this powerful tool (and am mostly starting from scratch)


## Research interests
- electrophysiology, brain stimulation, human behavior, cognition, neurodegneration and other neuropathologies

## Hometown
- Blackstone, MA
- currently live in East Boston, MA

## Hobbies
- painting, sculpture, tennis, fitness, music

## Fun fact
- I'm drawing a blank, so here's my favorite quote (and fact):
