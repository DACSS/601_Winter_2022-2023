## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to

1)  read in a data set, and describe the data using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2)  provide summary statistics for different interesting groups within the data, and interpret those statistics

## Read in the Data

Read in one (or more) of the following data sets, available in the `posts/_data` folder, using the correct R package and command.

-   railroad\*.csv or StateCounty2012.xlsx ⭐
-   FAOstat\*.csv ⭐⭐⭐
-   hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐⭐

```{r}
livestock <- here("posts","_data","FAOSTAT_livestock.csv")%>%
  read_csv()
livestock
```

Add any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.

In the above cell, I used read.csv() to store the FAOSTAT dataset within my livestock variable. Based on the output when calling the variable livestock, the variable types are as follows:

Domain.Code: String
Domain: String
Area.Code:Integer
Area:String
Element.Code: Integer
Element:String
Item.Code: Integer
Item: String
Year.Code: Integer
Year: Integer
Unit: String
Value: Integer
Flag: String
Flag.Description String

## Describe the data

Using a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).

First I used the head() function to determine that the dataset has fourteen variables. This dataset was likely gathered by survey. Then I used dim() to show that their are 82116 rows, representing the total number of values of livestock counts/estimates spanning various countries (Areas), Types (Items), and years (Years). Next I stored the columns into individual variables for ease of use later on. I used the n_distinct() and distinct() functions to show the number of unique entries in each column and to ouput these values. 

```{r}
#| label: summary
head(livestock)
dim(livestock)

Domain <- livestock$Domain
Area <- livestock$Area
Element <- livestock$Element
Item <- livestock$Item
Year <- livestock$Year
Unit <- livestock$Unit
Value <- livestock$Value


livestock %>% 
  select(Domain) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Domain) %>%
  distinct()

livestock %>% 
  select(Area) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Area) %>%
  distinct()

livestock %>% 
  select(Element) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Element) %>%
  distinct()

livestock %>% 
  select(Item) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Item) %>%
  distinct()

livestock %>% 
  select(Year) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Year) %>%
  distinct()

livestock %>% 
  select(Unit) %>%
  n_distinct(.)

livestock %>% 
  select(Unit) %>%
  distinct()

```

## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics

Conduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.

I first used the select() function to remove any columns/variables that were redundant or contained only 1 distinct value. I then used the head() to show the first 10 rows our new dataset to confirm that the desired variables were removed. Next, I stored the value (number of a given livestock) in a new variable. I calculated summary statistics of Value, and included the 'na.rm = TRUE' parameter so NA values were ignored. Following this, I created a new variable (Area) using the group_by() function. Using the summarise function, I then computed the mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR for the number of livestock, grouped by country. I calculated the summary statistics of the the data grouped by type of animal (Item) and year using the same method. 

```{r}
livestock_new <- livestock %>% select(-c('Domain', 'Domain.Code', 'Area.Code', 'Element', 'Element.Code', 'Item.Code', 'Year.Code', 'Unit', 'Flag'))

head(livestock_new)
Value <- livestock_new$Value


mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
median(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
min(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
max(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
var(Value, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR(Value, na.rm = TRUE)

Area <- livestock_new %>% group_by(Area)
Area %>% summarise(Value_mean = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_median = median(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_sd = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_IQR = IQR(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

Item <- livestock_new %>% group_by(Item)
Item %>% summarise(Value_mean = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_median = median(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_sd = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_IQR = IQR(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

Year <- livestock_new %>% group_by(Year)
Year %>% summarise(Value_mean = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_median = median(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_sd = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE), Value_IQR = IQR(Value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Explain and Interpret

Be sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.

I chose to group the data by Area, Unit, and Year in order to see how the values differed across these observations. I noticed that the mean Values differed by country, year, and animal type. One interesting observation was that greatest average Value was the number of Cattle while the smallest average Value was mules. In addition, the total Value tended to increase every year.
